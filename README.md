#  Pirates TreasureChest

Arg, matey!! This GUI integrated experience for Pirate users to do tasks
related to their wallets and having conversations with their slimy sea-rotten
Contacts, i.e. sending + receiving HushList memos.

This wallet supports Shielded Addresses and Shielded Transactions, as transparent
addresses are only used by landlubbers (and notary nodes).

This codebase uses the Electron framework to enable cross-platform support
and supports Linux, Mac and Windows.
